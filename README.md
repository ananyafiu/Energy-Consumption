# Energy-Consumption
# Introduction
We create a number of forecast models to estimate energy consumption across various industries and geographical areas by utilizing sophisticated statistical modeling techniques, such as time series analysis, machine learning algorithms, and scenario-based predictions. Our forecast's findings emphasize a number of important conclusions and their ramifications for utility companies and energy sustainability. We detect possible changes in the patterns of energy consumption, such as rising electricity consumption as a result of electrification trends and the growing significance of renewable energy sources. We also look at how future trends in energy usage may be impacted by consumer preferences, regulatory changes, and climate change. We offer practical suggestions for utility companies to successfully adjust and react to future patterns in energy consumption based on these insights. 
# Objective
This project tackles the energy sector's supply and demand mismatch by proposing strategies to improve market share, reduce energy waste, and promote sustainability through energy-efficient methods. It emphasizes demand-side management tactics, energy efficiency initiatives, and collaboration among stakeholders to address the challenges and seize opportunities for innovation. Overall, the paper offers actionable solutions to create a more robust, effective, and sustainable energy ecosystem.
# Data Overview
The dataset used for this analysis consists of smart meter readings from London households spanning from November 2011 to February 2014, totaling 5,567 households and 3,510,433 observations. It includes nine features providing insightful information on energy consumption patterns. Key features include House_ID for tracking households, Date for temporal analysis, Energy_Mean for average consumption, and Energy_Sum for total consumption. The dataset also incorporates household information like stdorTou indicating tariff type (standard or time-of-use), Acorn for demographic segmentation, and Category for home type classification. Additionally, weather and holiday data from the Dark Sky API enrich the analysis. Holiday data includes Holiday_Type and Holiday_Date, while weather data offers insights like Temperature_Max and Cloud cover.
# Methodology 
This paper utilizes a systematic approach combining preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, clustering analysis, and predictive modeling algorithms to analyze and predict energy usage patterns in London households.
# Results
The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variables (ARIMAX) technique was used and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)for predictive modeling for each user type. ARIMAX incorporates external factors like weather and holiday data to accurately forecast future energy demand by considering both autoregressive and moving average components.
# Conclusion and Future Work
Our research explored the impact of weather, holidays, and lifestyle choices on energy consumption in London households, uncovering significant influences. For instance, temperature variations directly affected heating and cooling needs, while holiday periods typically saw peaks in energy use. Lifestyle factors such as family size and socioeconomic status also played crucial roles, emphasizing the importance of demographic segmentation in understanding energy consumption patterns. Collect hourly data to predict peak hours. Explore the use of ensemble methods. Use Transfer Learning Techniques: deployment and Scalability.
